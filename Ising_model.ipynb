    "# Ising model with DASK\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model is a simple model of a ferromagnetic material. It consists of a lattice of spins, each of which can be in one of two states, up or down. The energy of the system is given by the sum of the interactions between neighboring spins. The model is often used as a simple example of a system that exhibits a phase transition, from a disordered state at high temperatures to an ordered state at low temperatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use DASK to simulate the Ising model. DASK is a parallel computing library that is designed to work with large datasets that do not fit into memory. We will use DASK to simulate the Ising model on a large lattice, and then use DASK to analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model is defined by the following Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "H = -J \\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle} s_i s_j\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the sum is over all pairs of neighboring spins, $s_i$ and $s_j$ are the spins at sites $i$ and $j$, and $J$ is the coupling constant. We will use the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the Ising model. The Metropolis algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that is used to sample from a probability distribution. In the case of the Ising model, we will use the Metropolis algorithm to sample from the Boltzmann distribution, which gives the probability of finding the system in a particular configuration."
